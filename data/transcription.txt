 Stark Thanos Tell me something Do you have an infinity gauntlet now? Back in my world Heroes were the cause of our end So I made a promise that no other reality would have to suffer the fate of mine. He's broken every rule imaginable in the multiverse.

The inspiration behind this video: 

Following their official return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe for Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, the Russo brothers go into depth about what was needed for them to make a comeback to Marvel Studios. 2024 marked a big year for Marvel Studios, as not only did Deadpool & Wolverine become a smashing success for the MCU timeline, but Phase 6 is looking stronger and better than ever. As Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars are still happening, the MCU will be having their most successful directors handling the two sequels with the return of the Russo brothers.

In a new interview with GamesRadar, co-director Joe Russo disclosed more on what was required in order for him and his brother Anthony Russo to agree to return to the MCU to helm both Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. Russo made it clear that having Robert Downey Jr. back was a must-have for their deal to go through.
