 Hey all, Jeff from Prefect here. Whether you're new to Prefect or a long-time user, the new serve method is a simplified way to create a Prefect deployment and get your workflow into production. So I've got a script here that's going to fetch some weather data. And I import a flow from Prefect and add my flow decorator to my function. Now, at the bottom here, I've got a new.serve method that I'm using and I am giving the name of the deployment and I am passing in a schedule so I can run this flow automatically every day. So when I run this script and then head over to the UI, our deployment has been created and I have all these flows scheduled to run each day. Getting your workflows deployed has never been easier. Head over to the docs.prefect.io or check out the code below.

Getting your Python code scheduled and into production should be easy, not complex.

Follow along with Jeff Hale as he puts he schedules his weather reporting code with the .serve() method including in Prefect. You can find the sample code here: https://gist.github.com/discdiver/93999e38db5249d7dc718e90134b18ab

With Prefect, your can turn your fragile scheduled scripts into resilient, repeatable workflows with just a few lines of code. To get started with Prefect Cloud, get your free account at https://app.prefect.cloud.
